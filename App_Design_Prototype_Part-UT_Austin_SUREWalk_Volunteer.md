# UT Austin SURE Walk Volunteer Application Prototype Made Using Figma (Group Project)
## By: Daisy Pinaroc

#### In this part of the prototype, I designed a section within the app where UT Austin SURE Walk volunteers could review their community service hours. They could view information regarding a certain shift or generate a cumulative summary displaying their hours and dates volunteered.
