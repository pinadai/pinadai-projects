# UT Austin Surewalk Volunteer Application Prototype Made Using Figma (Group Project)
## By: Daisy Pinaroc

#### In this part of the protoype, I designed a section within the app where UT Austin Surewalk volunteers could review their community service hours. They could view information regarding a certain shift or generate a cummulative summary displaying their hours and dates volunteered.
